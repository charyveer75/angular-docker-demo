# Angular Docker Demo

## Development server
Start the backend services with `docker-compose up -d`

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

You can run `docker-compose logs -f` to retrieve the logs of the backend services.

## Cleaning up
Stop the backend and delete all data with `docker-compose down -v`.
